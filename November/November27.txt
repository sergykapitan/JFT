Seeking God's Help  
"At times during our recovery, the decision to ask for God's help is our greatest source of strength and courage."
Basic Text, p. 26
 
When we take the Third Step, we decide to allow a loving Higher Power to guide us and care for us in our daily lives. We make the decision to allow this guidance and care into our lives. Some of us believe that, once we've made the Third Step decision, God leads us; from that point on, it's just a matter of paying attention to where we are led.
The Third Step decision is an act of faith, and asking for God's help is a way of renewing that act of faith. Putting faith to work in our daily lives gives us all the courage and strength we need, because we know we have the help of a loving Higher Power. We trust that our needs will be met. We can tap into that faith and trust just by asking.
Just for today:  I will remind myself that I'm not alone by asking my Higher Power for help each step of the way.
